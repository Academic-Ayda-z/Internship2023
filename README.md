# Internship 2023
Biobank project

Cardiac arrhythmia Detection from Ecg test using signal and image processing

I am being supervised by Associate Professor Zohre Azimifar at Shiraz University.

## Report of What I have done so far :

## Final report for Dr.Farshad Knunjush

## More Biobank reports on the details and steps of making it


## Segment anything model :
I used this code: https://github.com/Academic-Ayda-z/Internship2023/blob/main/sam.ipynb
to generate segmented images of cells used for Miss Sedaghat's thesis.
2500 cell images were segmented by hand and the Segment Anything model.

## Completed the ecg_plot ppt file for Dr.Karimi's presentation 
https://github.com/Academic-Ayda-z/Internship2023/blob/main/ECG_plots.pptx

and made new changes to the ecg_plot.ipynb file.

Read https://physionet.org/content/ecg-fragment-high-risk-label/1.0.0/ to understand the database([paper pdf link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1COB_y73jNy_6JlL_2GeeZF37AjLmUvhn/view?usp=share_link))and visualized some of them in [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gTstRn_Nq08Zk5gSuRHewYVE85lwDqeQ?usp=share_link).

made the source code of [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-heart-arrhythmias-with-deep-learning-in-keras-with-dense-cnn-and-lstm-add337d9e41f) run without any error.(which used [wfdb](https://physionet.org/content/wfdb-python/4.1.0/) )
